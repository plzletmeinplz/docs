By utilizing global resources from data centers to smartphones, we offer businesses scalable, affordable networking solutions.

With Ping, users can passively monetize their Internet connection — all while contributing to a faster, more efficient, and reliable Internet.

## **Understanding the Need for Ping**

The bandwidth market is heavily centralized, creating several challenges for businesses:
1. Expensive cloud providers provide limited global coverage with costs that wipe out all profit margins
2. Managing dedicated hardware from data centers requires manual management of thousands of servers, creating heavy operational load

At the same time, demand for bandwidth is rising rapidly. Content consumption is exploding. Who doesn’t love short videos, right? AI needs to pull massive amounts of data from the web as well.

As amount of data grows, businesses are stuck between costly cloud solutions and operationally heavy dedicated hardware. Neither option provides the scalability or global coverage they need.

With a $35B market lacking efficient solutions, businesses face ongoing challenges in growing efficiently.

That’s where Ping comes in.

## **The Opportunity**

Ping is unlocking next-gen networking solutions by tapping into global bandwidth, from data centers to user devices. Our infrastructure scales fast, skipping the heavy investment costs and delays that centralized players face.

1. Need more bandwidth? Scale up. Need less? Scale down. No more headaches when business blooms

2. Pay only for what you actually use, no wasted cash on idle servers

3. While big players like AWS operate in just 34 locations, Ping’s coverage spans worldwide

4. With thousands of independent contributors, Ping is rock-solid, avoiding single point of failure

It’s time to rethink how Internet operates. Ping makes it scalable, reliable, and rewardable.
